This is a practice project I did while following along with a tutorial from the amazing Kevin Powell.

His version was a sign-up for a BBQ restaurant, but I wanted to change it up for myself.  The more I played with the Irish color scheme, the more I realized how difficult green and orange were to work with.  I decided it might be funny to design something truly horrendous, and this is the end result!
